# Comparing Dollar-Cost Averaging Strategies Across Different Assets

Welcome to my second GitHub repostiory! This project provides scripts for fetching financial data of various assets from Yahoo Finance, performing data cleaning and transformation, and visualizing the results using the R programming language. The visualizations include both static and animated plots to compare the performance of different investment strategies like Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) across four asset classes: Bitcoin, S&P 500, Gold, and Oil.

## Features

- Fetch and process historical financial data for multiple assets.
- Calculate and visualize Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) investment values.
- Handle missing data and ensure continuity in financial datasets.
- Generate both static and animated visualizations of the portfolio values over time.


## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have installed the following R packages: `tidyverse`, `quantmod`, `scales`, `gganimate`
